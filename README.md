# Development-of-a-Fixed-Wing-UAV-for-Live-Aerial-Reconnaissance
This repository documents the end-to-end design and development of a lightweight, cost-effective fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) intended for real-time aerial reconnaissance and optical surveillance.

The project covers the complete system lifecycle—from conceptual design and airframe selection to component integration, testing, and flight performance optimization. Emphasis was placed on achieving mission-specific performance requirements while maintaining ease of fabrication using in-house manufacturing capabilities.

Key highlights include:

1.Design and fabrication of a budget-friendly fixed-wing UAV platform optimized for live aerial surveillance

2.Airframe configuration selection based on aerodynamic efficiency, payload integration, and manufacturability

3.Development of a detailed, cost-optimized bill of materials (BOM) aligned with performance and weight constraints

4.Identification and resolution of flight performance issues, including center-of-gravity imbalances, control surface misalignment, and propulsion system positioning

5.Iterative testing and refinement to improve stability, control response, and overall flight reliability
